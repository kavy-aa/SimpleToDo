## Notes

The person guiding the viewer through the tutorial while making this ToDo app did not show what we were going to 
be importing so it was quite difficult seeing all the errors and trying to figure it out by myself. The tutorial also 
shows a mac user walking us through and that also created some confusion since I use a windows laptop and the settings
were slightly different. Not to mention the tutorials were 3 years old so the way AndroidStudio looked and some of the 
settings were quite different.
